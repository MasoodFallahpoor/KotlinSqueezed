/*********************
 *  Functions Types  *
 *********************/

/**
 * Kotlin uses a family of function types like (Int) -> String for declarations that deal with
 * functions.
 *
 * These types have a special notation that corresponds to the signatures of the functions, i.e.
 * their parameters and return values:
 * - All function types have a parenthesized parameter types list and a return type. So
 *   (A, B) -> C denotes a type that represents functions taking two arguments of types A and B
 *   and returning a value of type C. The parameter types list may be empty, as in () -> A.
 * - Function types can optionally have an additional receiver type, which is specified before a
 *   dot in the notation: the type A.(B) -> C represents functions that can be called on a receiver
 *   object of A with a parameter of B and return a value of C.
 * - Suspending functions belong to function types of a special kind, which have a 'suspend' modifier
 *   in the notation, such as suspend () -> Unit or suspend A.(B) -> C.
 *
 * The function type notation can optionally include names for the function parameters:
 * (x: Int, y: Int) -> Point
 *
 * To specify that a function type is nullable, use parentheses: ((Int, Int) -> Int)?.
 *
 * Function types can be combined using parentheses: (Int) -> ((Int) -> Unit)
 *
 * The arrow notation is right-associative, (Int) -> (Int) -> Unit is equivalent to the previous example,
 * but not to ((Int) -> (Int)) -> Unit.
 *
 * There are several ways to obtain an instance of a function type:
 * - Using a code block within a function literal, in one of the forms:
 *   - a lambda expression: { a, b -> a + b },
 *   - an anonymous function: fun(s: String): Int { return s.toIntOrNull() ?: 0 }
 * - Using a callable reference to an existing declaration:
 *    - a top-level, local, member, or extension function: ::isOdd, String::toInt,
 *    - a top-level, member, or extension property: List<Int>::size,
 *    - a constructor: ::Regex
 * - Using instances of a custom class that implements a function type as an interface.
 */

/**
 * The compiler can infer the function types for variables if there is enough information.
 */
val a = { i: Int -> i + 1 } // The inferred type is (Int) -> Int

/**
 * Non-literal values of function types with and without receiver are interchangeable, so
 * that the receiver can stand in for the first parameter, and vice versa.
 * For instance, a value of type (A, B) -> C can be passed or assigned where a A.(B) -> C
 * is expected and the other way around.

/**
 * A value of a function type can be invoked by using its invoke(...) operator:
 * f.invoke(x) or just f(x).
 *
 * If the value has a receiver type, the receiver object should be passed as the first argument.
 * Another way to invoke a value of a function type with receiver is to prepend it with the receiver
 * object, as if the value were an extension function: 1.foo(2).

/**
