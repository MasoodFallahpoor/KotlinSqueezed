     * Iterators can be obtained for inheritors of the Iterable<T> interface, including Set and List,
     * by calling the iterator() function. Once you obtain an iterator, it points to the first element
     * of a collection; calling the next() function returns this element and moves the iterator position
     * to the following element if it exists. Once the iterator passes through the last element, it can
     * no longer be used for retrieving elements; neither can it be reset to any previous position. To
     * iterate through the collection again, create a new iterator.
