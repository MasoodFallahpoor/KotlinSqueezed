     * other way. In particular, all children coroutines (coroutines created in the context of another Job) delegate
     * handling of their exceptions to their parent coroutine, which also delegates to the parent, and so on until
     * the root, so the CoroutineExceptionHandler installed in their context is never used. In addition to that,
     * async builder always catches all exceptions and represents them in the resulting Deferred object, so its
     * CoroutineExceptionHandler has no effect either.
